The web application supports a weekly summary view and detailed daily view.
The weekly summary view will show the user’s average, minimum, and maximum 
heart rate in the past 7 days.
The detailed daily view (for a selected day) will plot heart rate and blood 
oxygen saturation level readings for the selected day on separate charts.
The horizontal axis for the charts should be the time of day, and the vertical 
axis should be the measurement.
The minimum and maximum values should be visually indicated on the chart.
Third-party plotting libraries can be used for the plots.
The web application should allow the user to define the time-of-day range and 
frequency at which measurements will be requested.

The physician portal has a patient view, a patient summary view, and a patient's detailed daily view.
The all-patient view will list all patients by name with their 7-day average, maximum, and minimum heart rate.
The physician will be able to select a patient to view the patient's summary view and the patient's detailed view.
The patient's summary view is similar to the weekly summary view for a user, but also includes controls that allow the physician to adjust the frequency of measurement.
The patient's detailed day view will present the same information as the detailed day view for the user.
