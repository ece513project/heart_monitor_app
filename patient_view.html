<!-- Julia is working on this

The web application supports a weekly summary view and detailed daily view.
The weekly summary view will show the userâ€™s average, minimum, and maximum 
heart rate in the past 7 days.
The detailed daily view (for a selected day) will plot heart rate and blood 
oxygen saturation level readings for the selected day on separate charts.
The horizontal axis for the charts should be the time of day, and the vertical 
axis should be the measurement.
The minimum and maximum values should be visually indicated on the chart.
Third-party plotting libraries can be used for the plots.
The web application should allow the user to define the time-of-day range and 
frequency at which measurements will be requested.
